  # Remove Supabase Storage Configuration

  Since we're migrating to Cloudflare R2 for media storage, this migration removes
  the Supabase storage bucket and related policies that are no longer needed.

  ## Changes Made
  1. Remove storage bucket creation references
  2. Remove storage policies for media files
  
  ## Notes
  - Media storage is now handled by Cloudflare R2
  - The media_library table remains for tracking uploaded files
  - This is a cleanup migration to remove unused storage configuration
